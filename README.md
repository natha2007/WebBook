# WebBook
Website in which I'm trying to make a realistic flipbook customizable.
You will be able to add pages, to customize details such as the book cover or the pages displaying.
You will also be able to save and load books.

# Scripts
Took "turn.js" and "jquery.js" scripts out of a Youtube video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnzWoGe0so&t=2s"
for the flip book.
